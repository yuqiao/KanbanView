# CLI, API, Web Service and Kanban for Things 3

This repository contains a simple read-only CLI, API and Web Service for [Things3](http://culturedcode.com). It further includes an example web application to create a visual task-level overview (Kanban) of what is on your plate.

![view2020](https://github.com/AlexanderWillner/KanbanView/raw/master/doc/view-2020.png)

## Installation

To support the development, consider to buy the pre-compiled binary from the AppStore:

[![AppStore](https://github.com/AlexanderWillner/KanbanView/raw/master/doc/download_appstore-black.png)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kanbanview/id1507458952?mt=12&UO=kanbanview.app)

Besides this, you've different options:

2. Download a [release](https://github.com/AlexanderWillner/KanbanView/releases).
3. Install the library and command line tools: `pip3 install things3-api`
4. Star, fork and contribute to the lastest code: `git clone https://github.com/AlexanderWillner/KanbanView.git`

## Configuration

While everything should work out of the box, you might want to change some configuration aspects. To have a GUI for this is [Feature Request #19](https://github.com/AlexanderWillner/KanbanView/issues/19). For the time being, the following default values are shown here and you can change them by creating the file `~/.kanbanviewrc` (self compiled version) / `~/Library/Containers/ws.willner.kanbanview/Data/~/.kanbanviewrc` (AppStore version) or setting them as environment variables. Note that plain integer tags (such as `5`, `15`, or `60`) are being used to calculate the estimated time of task durations for today:

```ini
[DATABASE]
THINGSDB=/Users/myname/Library/Containers/com.culturedcode.ThingsMac/Data/Library/Application Support/Cultured Code/Things/Things.sqlite3
TAG_WAITING=Waiting
TAG_MIT=MIT
TAG_CLEANUP=Cleanup
```

## Application

The Kanban Application allows you to visualize the Things3 database following the Kanban approach (focused on tasks or on projects). It also includes some visualizations. There are different implementations of the application available.

The **static** version creates a snapshot of the current status and writes an HTML file to ```kanban-static.html```: `make run`.

The **dynamic** version runs a web application at [http://localhost:15000/kanban.html](http://localhost:15000/kanban.html) and updates the GUI via JavaScript automatically using the **Web Service**: `make run-api`.

The **app** version runs a macOS application via `make run-app`. You can also create a compiled bundle **KanbanView.app** version that encapsulates the scripts into an easy to use standalone macOS application.

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

The CLI allows you to access the Things3 database via the comand line:

```bash
$ things-cli inbox
 -  Inbox Todo  ( None )
```

It is also possible to get the information formatted as ```json``` strings:

```bash
$ things-cli --json next | jq
[
  {
    "uuid": "9CD92553-95D7-4CF2-B554-F1DE9F563018",
    "title": "Due Todo",
    "context": "Next Project",
   "context_uuid": "DED787E0-874A-4783-8F0F-0A02F87F8419",
    "due": "2152-08-28"
  },
  {
    "uuid": "4C5D620C-165C-41D2-BC5B-A34065348D92",
    "title": "Today Project Todo",
    "context": "Today Project",
    "context_uuid": "52ADBAB5-A0EC-4D3F-BF83-2D578DAE3AF3",
    "due": null
  },
  {
    "uuid": "2ECBE4AA-2E3F-49CC-AA38-CBFFBFD2B1FD",
    "title": "Todo with Checklist",
    "context": "Next Project",
    "context_uuid": "DED787E0-874A-4783-8F0F-0A02F87F8419",
    "due": null
  },
  {
    "uuid": "709794DA-EB89-4A1B-BBE5-2BF8424BBA28",
    "title": "Waiting for Todo",
    "context": "Next Project",
    "context_uuid": "DED787E0-874A-4783-8F0F-0A02F87F8419",
    "due": null
  }
]
```

Further, you can export data as ```csv``` via `$ things-cli --csv all > tasks.csv` and import the file into `Excel` via `File > Import > CSV file > Delimited / UTF-8 > Comma`:

![Excel](https://github.com/AlexanderWillner/KanbanView/raw/master/doc/csv.png)

However, the CLI is only in a beginning state. The original ```bash``` based version can be found at [another GitHub repo](http://github.com/alexanderwillner/things.sh). Overall commands are:

```bash
$ things-cli -h
usage: things3_cli.py [-h] [-j] [-c] [--version] command ...
