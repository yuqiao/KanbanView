## Command Line Interface (CLI)

The CLI allows you to access the Things3 database via the comand line:

```bash
$ ./src/things3_cli.py inbox
 -  Inbox Todo  ( None )
```

It is also possible to get the information formatted as ```json``` strings:

```bash
$ $ ./src/things3_cli.py --json next | jq
[
  {
    "uuid": "9CD92553-95D7-4CF2-B554-F1DE9F563018",
    "title": "Due Todo",
    "context": "Next Project",
    "context_uuid": "DED787E0-874A-4783-8F0F-0A02F87F8419",
    "due": "2152-08-28"
  },
  {
    "uuid": "4C5D620C-165C-41D2-BC5B-A34065348D92",
    "title": "Today Project Todo",
    "context": "Today Project",
    "context_uuid": "52ADBAB5-A0EC-4D3F-BF83-2D578DAE3AF3",
    "due": null
  },
  {
    "uuid": "2ECBE4AA-2E3F-49CC-AA38-CBFFBFD2B1FD",
    "title": "Todo with Checklist",
    "context": "Next Project",
    "context_uuid": "DED787E0-874A-4783-8F0F-0A02F87F8419",
    "due": null
  },
  {
    "uuid": "709794DA-EB89-4A1B-BBE5-2BF8424BBA28",
    "title": "Waiting for Todo",
    "context": "Next Project",
    "context_uuid": "DED787E0-874A-4783-8F0F-0A02F87F8419",
    "due": null
  }
]
```

However, the CLI is only in a beginning state. The original ```bash``` based version can be found at [another GitHub repo](http://github.com/alexanderwillner/things.sh). Overall commands are:

```bash
$ ./src/things3_cli.py -h
usage: things3_cli.py [-h] [-j] [-c] [--version] command ...

## Application Programming Interface  (API)

The API allows you to access the Things3 todos within other Python scripts:

```bash
$ make doc
...
class Things3(builtins.object)
     |  Things3()
     |  
     |  Simple read-only API for Things 3.
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  get_anytime(self)
     |      Get anytime tasks.
     |  
     |  get_inbox(self)
     |      Get all tasks from the inbox.
...
```

## Web Service

The web service allows you to access the Things3 database via a web service:

```bash
$ make run-server
Starting up...
Serving API at http://localhost:8088/api/{command}
```

Via ```curl``` you can browse the ```json``` data via command line:

```bash
$ curl -s http://localhost:8088/api/today | jq
[
  {
    "uuid": "D7D879D2-5A2D-48AA-AF8A-AADCEC228D2B",
    "title": "Today Todo",
    "context": "Today Project",
    "context_uuid": "52ADBAB5-A0EC-4D3F-BF83-2D578DAE3AF3",
    "due": null
  }
]
```

## Kanban Application

The Kanban Application allows you to visualize the Things3 database following the Kanban approach. There are different implementations of the application available.

The **static** version creates a snapshot of the current status and writes an HTML file to ```kanban-static.html```: `make run`.

The **dynamic** version runs a web application at [http://localhost:8088/kanban.html](http://localhost:8088/kanban.html) and updates the GUI via JavaScript automatically using the **Web Service**: `make run-server`.

The **KanbanView.app** version encapsulates the **dynamic** version in a macOS bundle (alpha). Note: when you download the pre-compiled binary, as the App is not digitally signed, you need to execute the following command once, after you've copied the bundle to the Applications folder: `xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/KanbanView.app`
